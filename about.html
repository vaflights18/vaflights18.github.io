  <br>
  <p>Virginia Flights Amateur Athletic Basketball program was established with a unique philosophy and commitment. Our mission is to provide athletes/young adults a safe and healthy environment where they will be taught the fundamentalsof sports, as well as teamwork, sportsmanship, self-esteem, leadership, accountability, receive mentorship, career planning and reach out to help those less fortunate. Using basketball to unite us, the young ladies in our program will be taught strong character, values, and respect that will assist them and align their life goals –Beyond the Scoreboard. Every member of the Virginia Flightsprogram will commit to community service. We believe that a person’s most useful asset is not a head full of knowledge, but a heart full of love, an ear ready to listen, and a hand willing to help others. We will never take sports too serious. We realize that we are lucky. The Virginia Flights strive to motivate each player to achieve their individual levels of success while creating excitement in the community.
  </p>
  <p>Our programis designed not only to help youth develop confidence in their own personal abilities, but also to develop the skills and traits required to become assertive leaders in their communities. It is absolutely crucial to us that we make sure we help them steer clear of all drugs, gangs, etc.
  </p>
  <p>While our program is committed to winning a championship, developing improved basketball players and to the total development of each player in every area of their life, it will not stop there. We are as equally committed to making a difference in someone else’s life. We believe that it doesn’t matter how educated, talented, rich or cool you believe you are, how you treat people ultimately tells all. Integrity is everything. We will live by this belief and show it both on and off the court.
  </p>
  <p>We will demand that our basketball players thrive in academics and will monitor their grades during the regular school year. Hence, it is a Virginia Flightsestablished purposeful goal, that each one of our players ultimately graduates from college, matures athletically, and maintains a high livability standard throughout the duration of their student-athlete time.</p>
  <p>By bringing together the discipline and training that comes with basketball skills development and meshing this with dedicated mentorship, we are committed to push our young ladies to aim high and put in their very best both on and off the court. Success is holistic. The coaching staff is dedicatedto ensure the progress of our players. Participating young ladiesare expected to maintain a healthy balance between training, work, family, and community. The young ladies in our program will be  taught to continually renew their intentions and align their life goals–Beyond the Scoreboard. It’s
  about hard work, finesse, and strength of mind. We will encourage our youths to be devoted and ambitious. Our coaching staff strive will attempt to provide the very best in terms of coaching quality and personal guidance.Where we fall short, we will not be ashamed to reach out for assistance.

  <h3 id="otc">ON THE COURT</h3>
  <br>
  <p>Heart, Defense, Free-Throws and lay-ups are our core belief. We realize as a program, we will not be successful without these core principles. Consequently, our staff will do everything to infuse these principles into every player’srepertoire.
  </p>
  <p>Regardless of the outcome of any game or practice our goal as an organization will be:
    <ul>
      <li>To provide a whole-some environment in which our young ladies can develop themselves</li>
      <li>The kind of coachstaffwe would want our daughters to play for. </li>
      <li>A team that will never lose sight of the fact that basketball is a game and it should be fun. We will never put winning ahead of the individual.</li>
      <li>A team that takes this opportunity to educate our young women. We will prepare them for the many decisions they will be making that will have long-range effects on the quality of their lives.</li>
      <li>A staff that will be able to answer with conviction YES to the question, did we make our players’ sport experience as rewarding as possible?</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>We will never argue with theofficials nor blame them for a loss.
  </p>
  <p>Once the team is selected, we will have rules. We will set goals as a team and individually. We will have one-on-one talks with the head coach or their designee. Motivation will be the key. In addition to verbal motivation, we will use a system of behavioral rewards called “go-aheads.” This system will be based on the amount of effort and the quality of performance demonstrated during practice. Out-standing efforts and accomplishments earn players go-aheads, which will allow them to get out of certain amount of running at the end of practice. Failure to put forth total effort or to remain alert throughout the practice, however, may result in extra running.
  </p>
  <p>We believe that failing to prepare is preparing to fail. Success and rewards don’t come to people just by accident. They come as a result of exhaustive, intelligent, and effective planning. In also believe that a team with character will beat a team of characters every time and therefore will win with class and lose with dignity.

  <h3 id="cmt">COMMITMENT</h3>
  <br>
    <p>Every member of the Virginia Flightsprogram will commit to one community service outreach a month. We believe that aperson’s most useful asset is not a head full of knowledge, but a heart full of love, and ear ready to listen and a hand willing to help others. We will never take sports to serious. We realize that we are lucky. For the most part, we haveeverything weneed to live and much, much more.But the people at homelessshelters, living in the streets have only what’s on their back, and despite their lack of material possessions, they are content and were very grateful and excited when people when given even the smallest of gifts.I distinctly remember giving out food to the homeless and there was a young man that showed up with barely nothing that went to school with me. He hollered out my nickname and when we caught eyes I was humbled to the ground. When I handed him some food, he had the most grateful look in his eyes. He was truly grateful and happy for the food and conversation he received. And then something hit me: Here I was, with a family that loves me, a house, heat, hot water, and lotsof food, a television, a bed, a computer, even an iPod, and so much more.But even with all of those blessings, I would get angry and be in a foul mood after my team would suffer a defeat. But all of the people we fed that day were happy with what they had, whether it be a free t-shirt, a toothbrushor even some sandwiches to eat.There is life Beyond the Scoreboard. There's no need to get angry or just feel down and blue because of a loss. It's not the end of the world.
